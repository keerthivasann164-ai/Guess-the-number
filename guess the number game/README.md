## 📖 Code Explanation (For Beginners)

### How the random number is generated (`script.js`)
```js
secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
```
- `Math.random()` → gives a decimal like `0.73`
- `* 100` → makes it `73.0`
- `Math.floor()` → rounds down to `73`
- `+ 1` → shifts the range from 0–99 to **1–100**

### How the guess is checked
```js
if (guess > secretNumber)  // Too High
if (guess < secretNumber)  // Too Low
if (guess === secretNumber) // Correct!
```

### How the attempt counter works
```js
attempts++; // Adds 1 every time the player makes a valid guess
```
